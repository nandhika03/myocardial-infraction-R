# ❤️ Myocardial Infarction Complications Prediction - R Project 📈

I worked on this project as part of my **Predictive Modelling** course final project. This course was a game-changer for me, offering deep insights into R and the mathematics behind predictive algorithms. 💡

## 🧠 Why This Project?
The dataset we chose is open-source and available [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/579/myocardial+infarction+complications).  
Despite heart disease prediction being a common theme in the data science world, this dataset presented its own complexities and challenges, making it an exciting learning experience. 🌟

## 📝 Project Workflow:

### 1️⃣ **Preprocessing the Data:**
- 🗑️ Removed degenerate columns.
- 🔄 Dealt with **missing values**, **skewness**, and **inconsistencies**.
- 🎭 Handled categorical predictors and created **dummy variables**.
- ✂️ Reduced dimensionality to streamline the dataset.

### 2️⃣ **Data Splitting:**
- 📊 Performed a **stratified split** due to the highly imbalanced target variable (presence/absence of complications).  
- Used a standard **80%-20% split** for training and testing datasets.

### 3️⃣ **Evaluation Metric:**
- Selected **Kappa** as the classification metric to ensure fairness for the imbalanced dataset. ✅

### 4️⃣ **Model Building:**
- Developed both **linear** and **non-linear** classification models.  
- 🏆 The **Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA)** model emerged as the best performer with the highest Kappa value (~3.8).
